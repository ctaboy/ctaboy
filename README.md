- ðŸ‘‹ Hi! Iâ€™m Clarisse, a Master's student in Computational Linguistics at the CUNY Graduate Center
- ðŸ‘€ Among many things, Iâ€™m interested in exploring the power of applying methods in computational linguistics to speech technologies, or even forensic linguistics!
- ðŸŒ± This spring semester, Iâ€™m learning how to use Python for cool things like language modeling and G2P conversion; semantics, and sociolinguistics and the politics of language
